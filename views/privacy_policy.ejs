<h5>Website Visitors</h5>
<p>
Like most website operators, My Medical Times collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the 
browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. My Medical Times's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information 
is to better understand how My Medical Times's visitors use its website. From time to time, My Medical Times may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, 
e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.<br>
My Medical Times also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on  <a href =
"https://www.mymedicaltimes.com"> https://www.mymedicaltimes.com</a> blog posts. My Medical Times only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses 
personally-identifying information as described below.
</p>

Certain visitors to My Medical Times's websites choose to interact with My Medical Times in ways that require My Medical Times to gather personally-identifying information.
